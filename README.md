# Co2emissiionLinear_regression
i have created a linear regression model on Co2 emission dataset.
This project uses Linear Regression to predict vehicle CO₂ emissions based on features like engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption. The model is trained and evaluated using a real-world dataset, with performance measured using MAE, MSE, and R² score.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Output: Predicts CO₂ emission with good accuracy
